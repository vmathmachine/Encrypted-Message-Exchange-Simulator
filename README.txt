The source code is in the folder "Source Code". It's written in C++.

The code can be run via the executable file "Simulation", which needs to be run in a terminal. On Linux, that's as simple as typing `./Simulation` from the current directory. You should likely be able to do something similar on Windows via the terminal or VS code's terminal. Alternatively, if you have Code::Blocks, you can open the Cryptography Project for CodeBlocks IDE folder and open Cryptography Project.cbp with Code::Blocks. From there, once you press the build button to build the project, you can run the simulation in the IDE by pressing the "compile and run" button. Alternatively, you should be able to import the source code into any IDE of your choice that supports C++.

To learn more about how to properly use this simulation, please check out the Project Report file. Please note that CANCEL can be used at almost any time to cancel an operation and go back, except when the console asks for numerical inputs.
